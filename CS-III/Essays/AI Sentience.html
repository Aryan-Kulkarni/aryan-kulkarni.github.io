    <h1>Sentient AI is Beneficial but...</h1>
    <p>
      AI sentience. Whenever you think of AI's you might think of the hit movie IRobot starring Will Smith. Well you're not that far off. AI’s are almost as advanced as they have been shown in sci-fi movies. Whether it's terminator or IRobot, the dawn of AI is among us, but what does that really mean for us? Well first let's take at the kind of AI we have today. Today’s AI consists of things like Apple’s SIRI or Amazon’s ALEXA. These AIs help us with basic tasks relating to our smart devices around the house or our smartphones. These AI’s are coded with responses and features and don’t really “think” for themselves. The AI’s we see in sci-fi movies, think for themselves and make decisions and have a physical and solid body. Realistically speaking, we are just a few years away from these “advanced” AI. Recently in news articles and conspiracy theories on the internet suggest that there was a new AI, developed by google which could think for itself and had a consciousness of its own. However it was reportedly “shut down” by Google when these allegations and leakes came out. Now we won’t know if these “leaks” are true or just a hoax but the idea of something like that being this close to us is certainly frightening. Some news we do know that is 100% confirmed and is directly from a primary source is the TESLA Robot. The TESLA Robot was first announced at Tesla’s semi-annual meeting, where CEO and Billionaire Elon Musk revealed their idea and concepts for a Tesla robot. The Tesla Robot’s main function is to do tedious tasks and do household chores. The Tesa Robot is a Humanoid looking robot with an AI built into it that will supposedly think for itself and do whatever jobs you ask it to do. At first this information seems a little sketchy and unreliable, but we have to remember that we are talking about Elon Musk here, the man who wants to put brain chips into people and is blasting people into space every other week. It’s not a surprise that AI sentience is on his dinner plate.

      Let's talk about the future of humanity and it relating to AI sentience. Artificial intelligence research has been going through a recent revolution. AI systems can now outperform humans at playing chess and Go, recognizing faces, and driving safely. Even so, most researchers say truly conscious machines — ones that don’t just run programs but have feelings and are self-aware are only a few years away from reality. Most researchers say the robots and AI won't pose a threat to humanity in the near future because of how vulnerable they would be. These machines will vastly exceed our problem-solving ability, but not everything is a solvable problem. The only response they could have to conscious experience is to revel in it, and with their expanded ranges of sensory perception, they will see things people wouldn’t believe. “I don’t think a future robotic species is going to be heartless and cold, as we sometimes imagine robots to be,” Lipson says. “They’ll probably have music and poetry that we’ll never understand.”
