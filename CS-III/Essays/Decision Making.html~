	As we start our ISP there are several factors that affect our progress and efficiency. Some of these factors include some bias that could either support the progression of the ISP or slow it down. For context, my ISP is an Eagle card that uses NFC technology to make sharing and promoting your business easier. I am working with 2 other team members on this project. These factors will significantly affect my decision-making in several ways that will affect my performance on this ISP project.

	One of the biases that affect my decision-making is confirmation bias. Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's pre-existing beliefs or hypotheses. For example, if we have information about the eagle card that we already know and we learn something new, or one of our team members suggests something new that we have never heard before, and we might not accept their proposal right away due to our confirmation bias and just sticking to what we know. There are times when a confirmation bias would be useful but however, but in our situation, it would most likely end up affecting us negatively because of our hot-headed team members who might not take new suggestions positively. A way we could avoid this bias would be to "Seek other viewpoints, especially from people you disagree with. Create a culture that encourages dissent. Encourage ‘devil’s advocates."(ANU, 2021). To overcome this bias, I personally intend to actively seek out and consider evidence and perspectives that challenge my existing beliefs and assumptions. Thus we could learn more information and collaborate better with team members.

	  Another Bias that could affect my team's decision-making process would be the Authority Bias. In this bias, the bias refers to our tendency to be influenced by an authority figure and listen to their opinions over our own. Sometimes authority bias takes place because it is a shortcut for our brains to use to save time and energy when making decisions. Authority bias could be used for example if our team has an idea but a teacher or a person on youtube has different opinions then we are more likely to listen to the authoritative figures' ideas over our own. Sometimes this might not be the best-case scenario, as your own idea could have been better or a whole new thought compared to the one the authoritative figure had. A way to overcome this bias would be "Whenever you have to follow any instruction, think with an open mind if you are doing the right thing. If you believe you have an important opinion against the decision, bring it up."(Productive club, 2022). I would overcome this by just following my own opinion over the authority figure. This shouldn't be particularly difficult as we are teenagers and we don't like to listen to authoritative figures anyway.

	  Contextual bias is another bias that will affect the ISP Decision making. Contextual bias is the tendency for consideration to be influenced by background information. This could happen when I already know something about my isp. Like NFC and I could use that to progress my isp. In this case, the bias would and probably could be used in a positive way. There really isn't a need to overcome this bias, since this bias positively affects my ISP.

	  Another bias is the in-group bias. In this bias, people have the tendency for people to give preferential treatment to others who belong to the same group that they do. An example of this bias would be how Mr. B treats Gaurav since Gaurav is his favorite student, Gaurav has more of a bias and hopefully, our ISP gets a good grade. But on a serious note, in-group bias is where a team would only listen to each other instead of getting help or insight from any of the other teams. In-group bias is hard to find, "Like all cognitive biases, in-group bias happens without us realizing it."(DecisonLab, 2022). A way to get over this bias would be to take in others' opinions and listen to other people and groups.

	  Finally, another bias would be an anchoring bias. "It’s also known as “first impression bias”, and relates to the tendency to leap to conclusions based solely on what we learned early on; once your opinion is formed, it can be difficult to consider other options. This bias is common where people are stressed or feel they have to make a snap decision."(timelyapp, 2022) This can happen when we jump to conclusions based on things we learned about NFC chips. This is a problem because we would not be able to learn new information and be stuck with old information. To get over this bias we would need to open our minds to new ideas and take in new information.
