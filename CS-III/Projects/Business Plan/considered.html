      <p> The first ISP I have considred is the Restaurant Picker by Andrew Nguyen. I considred this proposal at first because from personal experience, me and my friend group alsways have a tough time choosing where to go out to eat to, so I figured this would be a great idea. I decided to ultimatly reject it because, even though it is a great idea I would not like to make it, but instead use that ISP. So i will go with my own. Here is a link to the Restaurant Picker ISP <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/andrew-nguyen/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Restaurant Picker<a/></p>

      <p> The second ISP I considred is Boden Chen's AI ISP. I decided to choose this because I am intrested in AI and i believe it is a very intresting concept and the ISP descripption looks intresting. I decided to not go with this ISP is because I do not want boden to boss me around and yell at me as his ego is very high, I want to work on my ISP in a stress free, boden free enviroment. Link to boden's isp is <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/bo-hong-chen/Digital%20Portfolio/projects/plan.html">here<a/></p>

      <p> The 3rd Isp of my choosing is Evan Ye's ISP. I am intrested in this ISP because most of my friends are in it and because it looks intresting as it's purpose is to make coding and uderstanding coding languages a lot easier. The reason I am not choosing this ISP is because it looks very difficult and it already has several different members. The Link to their Isp is right <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/evan-ye/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">here<a/></p>

      <p> The 4th Isp of my choosing is Gautam's Free Trading ISP. I am very intrested in Business as it is my major and I am active in stock trading so this project sparked intrest in me as it will analyze the trends and give possible predictions of the stocks. i decided to not go with this ISP is for the same reason as the first one, that being that i would love to use the finished product but not make it myself. The Link to this ISP is <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/gautam-narayan/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">here<a/></p>

      <p> The 5th ISP of my choosing is, Kevin Sun's Artistic Ai. Recently i have seen videos of AI making painting's and art and I found it intresting how kevin is attempting to make a art style with Ai to enable it to draw picture. I did not go with this ISP because I do not properly understand the Use of this isp. <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/kevin-sun/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">here<a/></p>

      <p> The 6th ISP of my choosing is, Stefano's Automated keyboard & Mouse Isp. This Isp functions similary to hotkeys and would make it eaiser for users to do mudane tasks instead of taking up a lot of time to do them, this is what got me intrested in this project. I have chosen to not do this isp as i feel hotkeys already exist and that it is quite easy to program them. The link to his Isp is <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/stefano-giron/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">here<a/></p>

      <p> The 7th Isp of my choosing is, Suhraab's Game. I primalry considred this isp because it looks fun and it is a game. Tower defence games should not be that hard to make however, thus i will not be joining this isp. The link to the isp is located <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/suhraab-alimi/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">here<a/></p>

      <p> The 8th Isp of my choosing is, Vijay's Isp. The goal of this isp is to save small babies and animals from suffocation in cars, which i thought was very good, hence my consideration for this ISP. Again this is very important and a great ISP idea but I would like to work on something a little bit smaller. The link to his isp is <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/vijay-vemulapalli/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">here<a/></p>


      <p> The 9th isp of my choosing is, Varun's Lets Go! ISP. For the same reason as the first one, i chose this isp because my friends have a hard time choosing a place to go to when it comes time to hang out. hence this app would make that process very easy. The reason i have not decided to go with this isp is the same as the first one. The link to the isp is <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/varun-natarajan/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"l>here<a/></p>

      <p> Last but not least, the final and 10th isp of my choosing and the one i will actually be working on is my very own Eagle Card. I have currently partnered up with Gaurav Jha and the reason i have chosen the eagle card is because i feel like it might be thr future of business cards. Instead of handing out a simple paper business card, the eagle card will allow you to simply hold the card near a person's phone and thanks to the NFC technology, be able to display your website on their safari or google browsers. Our business plan and ISP are located right <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/aryan-kulkarni/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"l>here<a/></p>
