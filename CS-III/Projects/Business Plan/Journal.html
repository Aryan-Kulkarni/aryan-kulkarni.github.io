	<h4>Identity</h4>

	<p> The ISP that I am proposing will be the Eagle Card. (Name Could Change). I will be working with Gaurav Jha and hope for more of you to join us on this project. </p>

	<h4>Problem</h4>

	<p> The problem is that if you ever want to show anyone your digital portfolio or website, then it might be quite a challenge or even annoying to put the full URL to get to your destination. You especially do not want someone to wait around for 5-10 mins while you type in your long ass Url to show them your digital portfolio. If I were a random person and you came up to me to show me your digital portfolio and then you took my phone and started typing in the URL, I would just walk away. Plus I would probably not feel comfortable giving my phone to a random stranger.

	</P>


	<h4>Solution</h4>

	<p> Luckily I have the solution for you. The Eagle Card. The Eagle Card will utilize Near Field Communication (NFC), allowing the instant transfer of anything, from your contact info to your website and even all of your social media accounts. This way you wonâ€™t have to worry about typing out the whole long Url and getting your customer or stranger agitated. </p>

	<h4>Target Market</h4>

	<p> Our target market is students from the current computer science class but later on the broder target market would be adults, especially businessmen.</P>

	<h4>Competition</h4>

	<p> QR codes. They do the same thing we do but our thingy is much easier and faster since we use NFC.</p>

	<h4>Revenue Streams</h4>

	<p> Currently unknown. N/a </p>

	<h4>Marketing Activites</h4>

	<p> The way to market this item would be to post it around social media, get positive reviews on our websites and get the word out to people.</p>

	<h4>Expenses</h4>

	<p> Currently the price of a NFC chip is $0.60. Which is fairly cheap. We will source this from amazon whom will source from china.</p>

	<h4>Team and Roles</h4>

	<p> Current team members: Aryan, Gaurav. No current roles assigned yet.</p>

	<h4>Milestones</h4>

	<p> Milestones are located on the gantt chart linked right <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C-kUI8re-kPsLXhrx4tL62Fec03kHuWPqVlQmUn2MaI/edit?usp=sharing">here</a></p>
