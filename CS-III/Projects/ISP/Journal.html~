      <p> Some technical challanges we have faced are for example github. Managing our directoris and figureing out github is one of our technical challanges. As well as figuring out our technology needed for our ISP. We can solve this issue by learning about github and figuring out the technology needed for an ISP through youtube. </p>

      <p> One of the challanges is scheduling. Currently we have no idea of our schedule and our teammates schedules, relating to our isp. Our solution to that is creating a gantt chart with the proper schdeule and dates and share it with all our teammembers to get everyone caught up on the schedule </p>

      <p> Some of the interpersonal challanges are communication with my team members. we have frequent disccusons and arguments about the direction of our ISp as well as not being able to communicate with one of our members in a differnt class. Out solution to this would be to listen to everyones opinion and email the team member in a differnt class. </p>

I might struggle in this role due to having  no prior experience in some of the coding languages we will be using, which migh lead to delays and extended time on the ISP.
