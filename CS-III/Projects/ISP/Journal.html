      <h3> Personal Plans </h3>
      <p> Consider how NFC chips compare to other forms of identification technology, such as QR codes and barcodes. Update my project outline based on new findings. Ensure that my writing and github commits are clear, concise, and well-supported by my research. Take a break from my ISP and recharge, possibly by watching youtube, tiktok or playing games. <a href="https://github.com/CSAllenISD/2023-ISP-EagleCard/issues/27">issue</a> </p>

      <h3> Personal Plans </h3>
      <p> Personal plan for what I hope to achieve this week: I plan to continue working closely with Gaurav to identify and troubleshoot any technical issues that may arise. I also aim to prioritize clear and effective communication, ensuring that both of us are on the same page regarding project goals, timelines, and expectations. This includes our very bad shceduling problems. In addition, I plan to focus on making steady progress towards completing specific tasks and milestones, taking care to break down larger goals into more manageable steps. </p>

	<h4>Technical challenges </h4>

	<p> As we worked to develop our NFC chip device. One major challenge was identifying and addressing issues related to the integration of various components, which required careful troubleshooting and testing. Additionally, we had to contend with unexpected bugs and errors that arose during the development process, which slowed our progress and required us to rethink certain design choices </P>
      


      <h2>11-April-2023</h2>

      <h4>Technical challenges </h4>
      <p> This week, our group faced a number of challenges as we continued developing our NFC chip device. From a technical standpoint, we encountered difficulties in integrating various components, which led to unexpected errors and delays in our progress. </p>

      <h4> Scheduling Challanges </h4>
      <p>  Additionally, scheduling conflicts among team members caused us to miss important deadlines, leading to frustration and a sense of disorganization. The main cause of this is gaurav wanting to go to huddle rooms all the time to play games instead of working.</p>

      <h4> Interpersonal Challenges </h4>

      <p> We also experienced interpersonal challenges, such as disagreements over design choices and communication breakdowns that made it difficult to work together effectively. </p>

      <h2>27-March-2023</h2>

      <h4> Technical challenges </h4>

      <p> Finishing all the journal entries and figuring out github. Also I think i found the right app for the nfc chips. One of the main technical challenges of working with NFC chips is interference from other electronic devices or materials. This can cause signal loss, data corruption, or other issues. You may need to take steps to reduce interference, such as shielding the chips or using specialized equipment.
      </p>

      <h4> Scheduling Challanges </h4>

      <p> Time Management: When working on an independent project, it can be challenging to manage my time effectively. I often find myself struggling to balance competing priorities, such as my isp, personal commitments, and other professional obligations such as my job. Also with no one overseeing my work or telling me what to do, it can be challenging to hold myself accountable and ensure that I am making progress on my project.
	     
	still trying to recover from the loss of our teammate but we had a good disccusion about the project. </P>

      <h4> Interpersonal Challenges </h4>

      <p> finishing everything on time. Im running behind schedule </p>

      <h2>20-March-2023</h2>

      <h4> Technical challenges </h4>

      <p> NFC technology has a limited range of around 10 centimeters, which can be a challenge if you need to communicate with a device that is further away. I may need to explore alternative communication protocols or find ways to extend the range of the NFC chips, such as using external antennas. I tried coding in a nfc app however ran in to some challenges into customizing its functions, so time to find a new app i guess </P>

      <h4> Scheduling Challanges </h4>

      <p> As the sole decision-maker in this project (because gaurav doesnt do much), I will need to make a lot of critical decisions, from selecting the right tools and technologies to determining project scope and priorities. It can be challenging to navigate these decisions on my own, particularly since I don't have a lot of experience working on NFC chips

	RESPONSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Our 3rd member responded. Turns out he did not know he was even a part of our project. LOL. But now he said he will attempt to help in any way possible. However he already has a differnt ISP so I guess that means we do not have a 3rd member. Quite unfortunate really. </P>

      <h4> Interpersonal Challenges </h4>

      <p> Not having a 3rd member really made me sad but we havent had one this entire time so it shouldnt make a difference, but its kinda discouraging </p>

      <h2>13-March-2023</h2>

      <h4> Technical challenges </h4>

      <p>NFC chips require a certain amount of power to function, which can be a challenge if you need to use them in low-power devices such as sensors or wearables. You may need to explore ways to optimize power consumption or find alternative power sources, such as energy harvesting techniques.
	Working on and leanring how to use Github  NFC chips can be vulnerable to data security threats such as eavesdropping or hacking. I  will need to implement robust security measures to protect your data, such as encryption or authentication protocols.
      </P>

      <h4> Scheduling Challanges </h4>

      <p> figuring out when and how we are going to meet up and work </p>

      <h4> Interpersonal Challenges </h4>

      <p> Small disagreements on how we should do the ISP, but ended up coming to an agreement in the end </p>




      


      <h2>27-Feb-2023</h2>

      <h4> Technical challenges </h4>

      <p> The NFC chips got delayed. Even tho I have prime shipping. We still have not decided on which app to use </p>

      <h4> Scheduling Challanges </h4>

      <p> Gaurav was absent for one class and I was also not present another day so productivity really went down as well as communication </p>

      <h4> Interpersonal challenges </h4>

      <p> Lack of motivation. We are having more fun talking to our friends and just messing around than working on ISP </p>




      

      <h2>20-Feb-2023</h2>

      <h4> Technical challenges </h4>

      <p> The wifi was really iffy today, at home and often times at school. Affected the productivity </p>

      <h4> Scheduling Challanges </h4>

      <p> Guess what im about to say. Yup NO RESPONSE, yet again from our 3rd member. We will just wait patiently </p>

      <h4> Interpersonal challenges </h4>

      <p> No interpersonal challanges this week </p>



      


      <h2>13-Feb-2023</h2>

      <h4> Technical challenges </h4>

      <p> Me and gaurav are now in the process of figuring out which app is best sutiable for our chips as we now beleive we have the right nfc chip <p>

	<h4> Scheduling Challanges </h4>

      <p> Me and gaurav talked about what we want to do with this ISP, and had a small call about the future implecations of this project </p>

      <h4> Interpersonal challenges </h4>

      <p> To be honest the only interpersonal challenges we have is staying on task and being prodcutive </P>


      



      <h2>6-Feb-2023</h2>

      <h4> Technical challenges </h4>

      <p> What can i say... once again we have heard nothing, absolutly nothing from our boy joshua. to resolve this however we did send him another email. We shall now patiently wait for his response </P>

      <h4> Interpersonal challenges </h4>

      <p> Interpersonal challanegs this week was mainly to stay on task and be focused. For some reason chess is a trend right now, i guess, and all my friends are playing it, so ofc I am. This is distratcing during class </P>



      <h2>23-Jan-2023</h2>

      <h4> Technical challenges </h4>

      <p> Some technical challenges would be that figuring out which nfc chip would work the best with out product </p>

      <h4> Scheduling Challanges </h4>

      <p> Some scheduling challanges would be that we still havent been able to contact our 3rd group member. Joshua alvarez..... </p>

      <h4> Interpersonal challenges </h4>

      <p>  No interpersonal challenges this week :) </p>



      


      <h3>16-Jan-2023</h3>


      <p> Some technical challanges we have faced are for example github. Managing our directoris and figureing out github is one of our technical challanges. As well as figuring out our technology needed for our ISP. We can solve this issue by learning about github and figuring out the technology needed for an ISP through youtube. </p>

      <p> One of the challanges is scheduling. Currently we have no idea of our schedule and our teammates schedules, relating to our isp. Our solution to that is creating a gantt chart with the proper schdeule and dates and share it with all our teammembers to get everyone caught up on the schedule </p>

      <p> Some of the interpersonal challanges are communication with my team members. we have frequent disccusons and arguments about the direction of our ISp as well as not being able to communicate with one of our members in a differnt class. Out solution to this would be to listen to everyones opinion and email the team member in a differnt class. </p>

<h2> (Software) Development Engineer </h2>

      <p>
	Develop the user interface and other visual aspects of the application. They are responsible for creating and designing the features that the user directly interacts with.designing, building, and maintaining server-side of web applications. Their primary responsibilities are to build the structure of a software application. I feel like i would be sutiable for this role because it would give me a oppurtinity to learn how to code and advance my knowlege in different coding languages. I might struggle in this role due to having  no prior experience in some of the coding languages we will be using, which migh lead to delays and extended time on the ISP.
	
	

</p>




<h2> QA Engineer </h2>
  
<p>

  QA Engineers are specialists whose activities are focused on improving the software development process by detecting errors. Additionally, they focus on preventing said errors from happening again. Additionally, this role focuses on developing, implementing, and preserving the quality of the product. This role works to ensure that the final product meets the quality expectations of the group's planned product. I would be sutiable for this role because I am a sort of perfectionist and i would like to make sure everything works and is in order. I might experience challanges in this role  because i might overlook somethings sometimes when i don't think they are important but then later on they end up being important.
	
      </p>
    




  <h2> Project Manager </h2>
  
  <p>

    The project manager is responsible for the planning and overseeing of the timeline and maximizes efficiency in the team through organization. They verify that the product is completed in a satisfactory manner and is ready for release. It is important to make sure everyone is doing their part correctly. I feel like I would be sutiable for this role because I have had experience in this role many times before and as a future business major i feel like this could benefit me. Some challanges I might encounter during this role might be effectively leading my group and managing all of our schdules and deadlines.
	  
  </p>

  <h2> Product Manager </h2>

  

  <p>
The product manager controls product planning, and should have a detailed perception for what the final product should look like. The product manager should check in with all other roles to ensure progress is being made, and specializes in features that will be present in the application. Furthermore, the product manager also works with the project manager to ensure that the team follows a structured timeline so that the application can be finished when it is due. I feel like i would be sutiable fot this role because i would want to see our finished ISP and i have an idea of what it looks like and I feel like i would be able to see our vison through. This role might be difficult for me because i have never been a product managerbefore and i do not know the kind of things required to be a good product manager.


    
	</P>

  <h2> Release Engineer </h2>
  
  <p>

The Release Engineer is responsible for implementing and managing release processes for code through development, test, and production environments. This role focuses on coordinating different aspects of production into the overall product. I feel like I would be suitable for this role because I want to finish the ISP before the deadline and I ant to make sure it comes out smoothly and without any problems, and i would like to see that through. This role might be troublesome for me, because knowing myself i will defintly overlook somethings that might end up being important.
