      <h3>20-March-2023</h3>

      <h4> Technical challenges </h4>

      <p> I tried coding in a nfc app however ran in to some challenges into customizing its functions, so time to find a new app i guess </P>

      <h4> Scheduling Challanges </h4>

      <p> RESPONSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Our 3rd member responded. Turns out he did not know he was even a part of our project. LOL. But now he said he will attempt to help in any way possible. However he already has a differnt ISP so I guess that means we do not have a 3rd member. Quite unfortunate really. </P>

      <h4> Interpersonal Challenges </h4>

      <p> Not having a 3rd member really made me sad but we havent had one this entire time so it shouldnt make a difference, but its kinda discouraging </p>

      <h3>27-Feb-2023</h3>

      <h4> Technical challenges </h4>

      <p> The NFC chips got delayed. Even tho I have prime shipping. We still have not decided on which app to use </p>

      <h4> Scheduling Challanges </h4>

      <p> Gaurav was absent for one class and I was also not present another day so productivity really went down as well as communication </p>

      <h4> Interpersonal challenges </h4>

      <p> Lack of motivation. We are having more fun talking to our friends and just messing around than working on ISP </p>

      <h3>16-Jan-2023</h3>


      <p> Some technical challanges we have faced are for example github. Managing our directoris and figureing out github is one of our technical challanges. As well as figuring out our technology needed for our ISP. We can solve this issue by learning about github and figuring out the technology needed for an ISP through youtube. </p>

      <p> One of the challanges is scheduling. Currently we have no idea of our schedule and our teammates schedules, relating to our isp. Our solution to that is creating a gantt chart with the proper schdeule and dates and share it with all our teammembers to get everyone caught up on the schedule </p>

      <p> Some of the interpersonal challanges are communication with my team members. we have frequent disccusons and arguments about the direction of our ISp as well as not being able to communicate with one of our members in a differnt class. Out solution to this would be to listen to everyones opinion and email the team member in a differnt class. </p>

<h2> (Software) Development Engineer </h2>

      <p>
	Develop the user interface and other visual aspects of the application. They are responsible for creating and designing the features that the user directly interacts with.designing, building, and maintaining server-side of web applications. Their primary responsibilities are to build the structure of a software application. I feel like i would be sutiable for this role because it would give me a oppurtinity to learn how to code and advance my knowlege in different coding languages. I might struggle in this role due to having  no prior experience in some of the coding languages we will be using, which migh lead to delays and extended time on the ISP.

<h2> QA Engineer </h2>
  
<p>

  QA Engineers are specialists whose activities are focused on improving the software development process by detecting errors. Additionally, they focus on preventing said errors from happening again. Additionally, this role focuses on developing, implementing, and preserving the quality of the product. This role works to ensure that the final product meets the quality expectations of the group's planned product. I would be sutiable for this role because I am a sort of perfectionist and i would like to make sure everything works and is in order. I might experience challanges in this role  because i might overlook somethings sometimes when i don't think they are important but then later on they end up being important.
	
      </p>
    




  <h2> Project Manager </h2>
  
  <p>

    The project manager is responsible for the planning and overseeing of the timeline and maximizes efficiency in the team through organization. They verify that the product is completed in a satisfactory manner and is ready for release. It is important to make sure everyone is doing their part correctly. I feel like I would be sutiable for this role because I have had experience in this role many times before and as a future business major i feel like this could benefit me. Some challanges I might encounter during this role might be effectively leading my group and managing all of our schdules and deadlines.
	  
  </p>

  <h2> Product Manager </h2>

  

  <p>
The product manager controls product planning, and should have a detailed perception for what the final product should look like. The product manager should check in with all other roles to ensure progress is being made, and specializes in features that will be present in the application. Furthermore, the product manager also works with the project manager to ensure that the team follows a structured timeline so that the application can be finished when it is due. I feel like i would be sutiable fot this role because i would want to see our finished ISP and i have an idea of what it looks like and I feel like i would be able to see our vison through. This role might be difficult for me because i have never been a product managerbefore and i do not know the kind of things required to be a good product manager.


    
	</P>

  <h2> Release Engineer </h2>
  
  <p>

The Release Engineer is responsible for implementing and managing release processes for code through development, test, and production environments. This role focuses on coordinating different aspects of production into the overall product. I feel like I would be suitable for this role because I want to finish the ISP before the deadline and I ant to make sure it comes out smoothly and without any problems, and i would like to see that through. This role might be troublesome for me, because knowing myself i will defintly overlook somethings that might end up being important.
