    <h1> 5-May-2023 Topic: Should Ai be regulated by the Government </h1>

    <p> Althought Ai helps us a lot with mudane tasks, I feel as if Ai should be regulated as advancements in Ai will lead to further economic and social crises. The neweset AI's are able to write full stories, create songs, as well as replicate celebrity voices. This is a threat to society as peoples words can be amnipulated by Ai and can be harmful to the lives of people being inpersonated by AI. IF not regulated, Ai will spiral out of control and might lead to the stuf we see in the moviess such as Full robot take over and Ai world domination. An example of this is Ultron from marvel who is a AI which built a physical body for itself and attempted to genocide all humans and concur the world. Even though out AI is currently not this advanced, we should still be vary of the threats and consequences of AI.
